# GeeksforGeeks Data Science Challenge

Welcome to my GeeksforGeeks Data Science Challenge project repository. In this project, I've taken on the role of a data scientist to analyze and derive insights from two datasets: Swiggy Restaurants Data and GeeksforGeeks YouTube Channel Data. This challenge was part of the GeeksforGeeks hiring process for a Technical Content Engineer role.

## About the Project

In this project, I've tackled two separate analyses: Swiggy Restaurants Analysis and GeeksforGeeks YouTube Channel Analysis. These analyses involve extracting meaningful information from the provided datasets and answering a series of questions related to each dataset.

### Swiggy Restaurants Analysis

In this part of the project, I delved into Swiggy's restaurant data to uncover valuable insights about the relationship between restaurants and customers. I addressed various questions such as:

- Identifying the cities where Swiggy has restaurants listed.
- Finding the most expensive cities in the dataset.
- Listing the top-rated and least-rated restaurants.
- Analyzing the popularity of restaurant chains and more.

The analysis is performed using Python programming and data manipulation libraries, showcasing my skills in data preprocessing, visualization, and analytical thinking.

### GeeksforGeeks YouTube Channel Analysis

For the GeeksforGeeks YouTube Channel Analysis, I scraped data from the GeeksforGeeks YouTube channel using the Google API to gain insights into their video publications. The analysis included:

- Determining the number of videos uploaded in the past 6 months.
- Creating a pandas DataFrame with video details.
- Identifying the most viewed and longest videos.
- Visualizing the relationship between views and video length.

The scraping and analysis were done using Python, illustrating my web scraping abilities and proficiency in data manipulation and visual analytics.
